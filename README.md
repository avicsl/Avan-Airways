# Avan Airways Flight Booking System

**Avan Airways** is a desktop-based airline booking system inspired by Cebu Pacific. It is designed to streamline flight reservations and provide users with an intuitive platform to view flights, book tickets, manage reservations, and access essential travel information.

## Project Overview

Developed as the **final requirement for our Information Management course**, this project demonstrates our proficiency in relational database management, system design, and user-focused application development.

Rather than emphasizing web or mobile development, Avan Airways focuses on the back-end logic and database operations required to run a functional airline reservation system.

## Key Features

- **Flight Listings**: Browse and search available flights by route, date, and time.
- **Ticket Booking**: Reserve flights, input passenger details, and confirm bookings.
- **Reservation Management**: View, modify, or cancel booked tickets.
- **Travel Information**: Access key flight policies and travel guidelines.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: For Java development and project management.
- **SceneBuilder**: To design JavaFX-based user interfaces.
- **MySQL**: As the core relational database system for storing flights, bookings, and passenger information.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Relational Database Design**: Implementation of normalized, scalable schemas for real-world applications.
- **System Architecture**: Integration of frontend (JavaFX) and backend (MySQL) components.
- **User Experience**: Designing interfaces that support smooth user interactions with minimal complexity.
